    <h3>"Cam"</h3>
    <p>Hello fellow classmates! My name is Camden Asay. I am the oldest of 4 siblings in my family, two of which are currently serving a mission and one will be leaving in 2 months. We have lived in Alaska for the past 10 years, and have enjoyed every moment of it, even during the long winters and windy summers. For my hobbies, I really like technical videogames like space engineers or from the depths. I will listen to almost any genre of music, depends on what I'm feeling that day.</p>
    <p>I served a mission in Fort Collins, Colorado. The gospel is very precious to me, and I love learning more about it and its beatuiful simplicity.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in applied technology, my focus being hardware and tech support. I currently work at an assisted living center taking care of their IT needs.</p>
    <p>I look forward to learning with all of you!</p>
