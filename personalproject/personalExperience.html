                <h4>Networking</h4>
                <p>Networking in IT refers to the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources, exchange data, and ensure efficient communication within and between organizations. It involves hardware components like routers, switches, and cables, as well as software and protocols that govern how data is transmitted and secured. A well-designed network supports business operations, enables collaboration, and provides access to critical services and information. As technology evolves, networking also plays a key role in cloud computing, cybersecurity, and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
