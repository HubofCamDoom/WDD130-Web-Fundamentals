                <h4>Brief Introduction</h4>
                <p>My name is Camden Asay. I am an information technology professional specializing in hardware and network tech support. Born and raised in Utah, I grew up enjoying the companionship of friends and family. I loved reading, especially anything that had to do with the mechanics of a contraption or vehicle.
                My favorite toy growing up was the wonderful building block system known as Legos. I would spend hours assembling and disassembling various creations, as I grew older, I was introduced to the technical side of my beloved plastic pieces, and my love for malleable complexities soared.</p>

                <h4>Tech Transition</h4>
                <p>In pursuing continued satisfaction of my creative itch, I discovered the allure of video games. Here, in these fantastical worlds of make believe driven by the power of imagination and millions of lines of code, I found in myself an increasing desire to learn about how these came to be. I started attending school with the aim of obtaining a degree in information technology. I wanted to build and create, but I was limited in my understanding of the complexities that surrounded our wired world.</p>

                <h4>Hobbies and Interests</h4>
                <p>I love Legos. I have been playing with them since my first set at 3 years old, which was a little motorcycle. This building block system has been one of my favorite past times for as long as I can remember. My collection now has increased a hundred fold and even now I still like to reminisce about different moc ideas.</p>
                <p>In recent years, I have had a growing interest in technology. Our first family computer was an old windows 98 dinosaur  with the big tube monitor that weighed as much as a dinosaur for some reason. I am still very fond of the memories of playing warcraft 2 and traxxas radio control racers deluxe. I loved videogames growing up, and that pursuit led me to want to learn more about the professional side of the industry and the machines that made it all possible.</p>
