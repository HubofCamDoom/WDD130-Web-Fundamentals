      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most important parts of my website will be to introduce myself and paint a professional picture of “Camden” to share with the world. The main content will essentially be a personal biography that tells of my life thus far and includes my experiences and education with the aim to sell myself to potential employers and interested individuals.
      </p>

        BIO - My name is Camden Asay. I am an information technology professional specializing in hardware and network tech support. Born and raised in Utah, I grew up enjoying the companionship of friends and family. I loved reading, especially anything that had to do with the mechanics of a contraption or vehicle.
        My favorite toy growing up was the wonderful building block system known as Legos. I would spend hours assembling and disassembling various creations, as I grew older, I was introduced to the technical side of my beloved plastic pieces, and my love for malleable complexities soared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tech transition - In pursuing continued satisfaction of my creative itch, I discovered the allure of video games. Here, in these fantastical worlds of make believe driven by the power of imagination and millions of lines of code, I found in myself an increasing desire to learn about how these came to be. I started attending school with the aim of obtaining a degree in information technology. I wanted to build and create, but I was limited in my understanding of the complexities that surrounded our wired world.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page will also contain links to my contact information.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>About Me | Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The home/about me page will include a personal portrait as well as a brief biography along with my interests and goals. The placeholder "flavor text" boxes will be used to contain content of the home page.
      </p>
      <img src="images/ppAboutMeHome.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Education & Experience</h3>
      <p>         
        The image descriptions will include a background explanation of any of the certificates/degrees I manage to achieve.
      </p>
      <img src="images/ppEduExp.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>         
        The layout of the third projects page will end up being very similar in presentation to the second page. The project descriptions will be of any personal or work related projects I work on to give examples of my experience in that respective field.
